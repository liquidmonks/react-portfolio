As a company, we have developed a single-page application portfolio using React, React icons, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

For the portfolio application:

- Go to https://www.node.js and download the Node.js installation package.
- Install Node.js on your computer.
- Open the command prompt or terminal.
- Install the Node package manager (npm) by running the following command: npm install -g npm.
- Navigate to the directory where you have saved the portfolio application.
- Run the command npm init to initialize the application and generate a package.json file that contains all the details of the application that you inputted during initialization.
- Follow the prompts to input the required information.
- Once the package.json file is generated, you can run the application using the npm start command.

For the React application:

- Open the command prompt or terminal.
- Run the command npx create-react-app <app-name> to create a new React application.
- Navigate to the directory where you have saved the React application.
- Run the command npm install to install the required dependencies.
- Run the command npm start to run the application in development mode.
- Run the command npm install react-icons --save to include popular icons easily with React.
- Run the command npm install @emailjs/browser.
- Run the command npm run build to build the application for production.
- Run the command npm install validator to validate email addresses.

By following these steps, you can install and run both the portfolio application and the React application.

For the EmailJS SDK:

    1. Install the EmailJS SDK using npm by running the following command in your project directory:
```
npm install @emailjs/browser
```
    2. Create a new .env file in your project directory.

    3. Add the following lines to your .env file:
```
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID=<your-emailjs-user-id>
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=<your-emailjs-service-id>
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=<your-emailjs-template-id>
```
Replace <your-emailjs-user-id>, <your-emailjs-service-id>, and <your-emailjs-template-id> with your actual EmailJS user ID, service ID, and template ID, respectively.

    4. In your Contact page, add the following code to your submit handler:

```
import emailjs from 'emailjs-com';

function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Perform EmailJS validation here

  emailjs.sendForm(
    process.env.REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID,
    process.env.REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID,
    e.target,
    process.env.REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID
  )
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result.text);
  }, (error) => {
    console.log(error.text);
  });
}
```

This code sends the contents of the Contact form to EmailJS for processing.

    5. Use the EmailJS validation API to validate the contents of the Contact form. You can find more information about EmailJS validation in their documentation.

By following these steps, you can add EmailJS validation to your Contact page and create a .env file to store your EmailJS credentials.

```
"homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>"
```
Replace <username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with the name of your repository.

    3. Install the gh-pages package by running the following command:
```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

    4. In the package.json file, add the following scripts:
```
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
```

    5. In the command prompt or terminal, run the following command to deploy the application:
```
npm run deploy
```
